              Automatic Replies Non-Proliferation Protocol

Abstract

   The widespread deployment of fully automated internet relay chat
   clients without coordination by their respective implementors and
   operators has thus far caused multiple message amplification
   incidents of indefinite duration.  There is a need for a standard
   protocol to limit PRIVMSG replies by automated clients from unplanned
   proliferation.  This document defines such a protocol.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) [RFC2812] protocol provides a standard
   mechanism to limit the proliferation of automic replies, by
   restricting automatic replies to NOTICE messages.  However, this has
   practically turned out to be ineffective as no one likes NOTICE
   messages in a channel.  Therefore, there is a need for an additional
   protocol that provides further safety against unplanned
   proliferation.

   As a fundamental enhancement of the IRC protocol is unlikely to be
   widely implemented by infrastructure operators and commonly used
   client libraries, any such proposed protocol needs to be a
   lightweight agreement that can be easily integrated on top of
   existing client implementations.  Additionally, it needs to be
   tailored to a specific deployment environment and local customs.

   This document addresses automatic reply non-proliferation for
   automatic clients deployed by individual participants in the "#cobol"
   channel on the synIRC network.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC2812] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  client

   *  nickname

   *  PRIVMSG

   *  NOTICE

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   bot:  A client that responds to messages from other clients in an
      automatic manner with no human oversight.

2.  Automatic Replies Non-Proliferation Design Objectives

   This section documents the design objectives for the non-
   proliferation protocol presented in Section 3.

2.1.  Non-Preregistration Requirement

   The synIRC network allows individuals to deploy new custom bots, and
   the "#cobol" channel allows such bots without prior registration by
   their operator with the channel authorities.  The bots may implement
   features as replies to messages from other clients.  Replies may
   either take the form of a response to an informal command invocation
   (Scaevolus 2008, adar 2019), or may be entirely free-form (tef 2007).

   It is not possible nor desirable to gain consensus on a static list
   of either bot identifiers or distinguishable form of bot responses
   that each bot implementation could use to recognize an automatic
   reply for the purpose of avoiding a further automatic reply.
   Additionally, implementers will not generally be available to take
   notice of changes to such a list and deploy updates to their bots.

   Since few assumptions can be made about an arbitrary automatic reply,
   a protocol cannot require tight coupling betewen implementations.  No
   configuration changes or tracking of known bots should ever be
   required, in particular not by channel operators.

2.2.  Simplicity

   There is concern that a complicated protocol will not be widely
   deployed because it is too much of a hassle to implement.  The
   complexity and the scope of the change required to each independently
   developed bot needs to be as minimal as possible.  Neither a deep
   understanding of the underlying IRC protocol nor a deep motivation to
   expend effort on any additional protocol work should be assumed.

   A single set of application-level guidelines ought to be able to
   prevent all cases of automatic reply proliferation, while still
   allowing access to the full functionality of the IRC protocol.

   Additionally, once a new bot is deployed, it should be trivial for
   both the operator of the bot or curious onlookers to validate that
   the bot implements the protocol correctly, before anything weird
   happens when no one is paying attention.

2.3.  PRIVMSG Interface

   "#cobol" bots use PRIVMSG messages to deliver replies to command
   invocations or general messages from other clients, themselves sent
   as PRIVMSG messages.

   While NOTICE messages are available as an additional facility
   provided by the IRC protocol, they are considered disruptive by users
   of weird clients that beep when they receive NOTICE messages, and
   otherwise also look kind of weird and different than normal messages.
   There is consensus that PRIVMSG messages to the channel are generally
   the only appropriate form of communication with and by bots in the
   channel.

2.4.  Special Exceptions

   Bots or operators of bots ought to be able to disregard the
   requirements of the non-proliferation protocol if it would be
   particularly funny or clever (floWenoL 2008).

3.  Automatic Replies Non-Proliferation Protocol (ARNPP)

3.1.  Overview

   This section provides a high-level overview of the non-proliferation
   protocl structure.  It describes the PRIVMSG message processing model
   and the conceptual filter requirements within that model.

3.1.1.  Features

   The ARNPP model provides the following features:

   *  Bots will not respond to each other.

   *  Operators will not have to kick bots because they won't shut up.

   *  Operators needing to kick bots because they're annoying for other
      reasons is beyond the scope of this document.

   *  No configuration or permission system is required.

   *  The protocol can unilaterally support non-participating bots that
      are minimally configurable so that their operator can choose their
      nickname.

   *  Third-party bots may be able to support the protocol if they are
      configurable to the extent that an "ignore" list with wildcards
      can be entered.

3.1.2.  External Dependencies

   The IRC protocol [RFC2812] is used to define the data model of a
   nickname.

3.1.3.  Message Processing Model

   The following diagram shows the conceptual message flow model,
   including the points at which a filtering rule is applied during
   PRIVMSG message processing.

               +-------------------------+
               |         poster          |
               |        (nickname)       |
               +-------------------------+
                  |                 ^
                  V                 |
               +-------------------------+
               |         channel         |
               |        (#cobol)         |
               +-------------------------+
                  |                 ^
                  V                 |
               +-------------------------+
               |           bot           |
               | (a regexp or something) |
               +-------------------------+

   The following high-level sequence of conceptual processing steps is
   executed for each received PRIVMSG message by the bot, typically
   before any further processing that could result in a reply to the
   channel:

   *  The filtering rule is applied individually to all PRIVMSG messages
      received by the server, unless the PRIVMSG is to the bot directly
      instead of to the channel, in which case you're on your own I
      guess.

   *  If the filtering rule matches, the bot SHOULD not fuck around,
      except if it would be particularly funny or clever, and either the
      bot's operator or a channel operator is available to step in if
      things get out of hand.

   *  Otherwise, the bot SHOULD PROBABLY proceed as normal.

   *  If the bot, in the normal processing of the message, would be
      about to send a message addressing specifically to another client,
      it MAY use its best judgment to maybe not do that if a PRIVMSG
      message from the target client WOULD match the filtering rule.

3.2.  The Filtering Rule

   When processing a message, and the message originated from another
   client, the bot MUST inspect the nickname of the sender of the
   message to determine if it is human.

    The Augmented BNF representation for a human is:

    human      =  ( letter / special ) [ letter / digit / special ]
               =/ ( letternob / special ) *2( letter / digit / special )
               =/ ( letter / special ) *( letter / digit / special )
                  letternot
               =/ ( letter / special ) *( letter / digit / special )
                  letternoo ( letter / digit / special)
               =/ ( letter / special ) *( letter / digit / special )
                  letternob 2( letter / digit / special)
    digit      =  %x30-39
    special    =  %x5B-60 / %x7B-7D
    letter     =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A
    letternob  =  "A" / %x43-5A / "a" / %x63-7A
    letternoo  =  %x41-4E / %x50-5A / %x61-6E / %70-7A
    letternot  =  %x41-53 / %x55-5A / %x61-73 / %75-7A

   If the nickname is not human, the bot MUST NOT reply to the message,
   with the exception outlined in the preceding section.

   The same filtering rule applies to all nicknames that are involved in
   sending or receiving messages.  All PRIVMSG messages are controlled
   by the ARNPP.  Storing nicknames in .tells, .remembers, tags, or
   questionably consensual geolocation databases is not controlled by
   the ARNPP.

4.  IANAL Considerations

   I'm a document, not a lawyer.

5.  Security Considerations

   Implementations SHOULD be really careful if they end up using C
   string processing facilities to evaluate the filtering rule.
